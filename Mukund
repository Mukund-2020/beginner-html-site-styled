    <p>Hi there, My name is Mukund Balaji. This is my first page I have ever coded. It isn't perfect, but, I am very new to HTML coding. </p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>technologists</li>
      <li>thinkers</li>
      <li>builders</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have learned the basics of VSCODE is this camp/workshop</p>

    <p></p>
  </body> VSCode is the coding software which can be used for coding things. HTML is the most basic form of coding then there is the Javasript, and finally, CSS, where the "cool stuff" takes place.

</body> I am new to this so, don't kill me, or burn me at the stake. I like reading wikipedia articles when I am bored, and playing Microsoft Flight SImulator X: Steam Edition. I also enjoy 3D modelling and messing around in Blender. I also bike a lot.
